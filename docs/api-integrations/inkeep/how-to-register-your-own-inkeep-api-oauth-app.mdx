This guide shows you how to register your own app with Inkeep to obtain your OAuth credentials (client id & secret). These are required to let your users grant your app access to their Inkeep account.

<Note>Creation of OAuth Applications for the Inkeep API is not self-service. You'll need to contact the Inkeep team to set one up.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request OAuth application">
    Contact the Inkeep team at [support@inkeep.com](mailto:support@inkeep.com) to request an OAuth application.
    
    Provide the following required information:
    - **Name**: How you want your app identified to your customers (most likely your company/product name)
    - **Redirect URI**: `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`
    - **Scopes**: The set of data your application needs access to (e.g., `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `offline_access`, `agents`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive your credentials and API URLs">
    Once your OAuth application is created, Inkeep will provide you with:
    - **Client ID**
    - **Client Secret**
    - **Manage API URL** - The OAuth/Auth server URL (e.g., `https://manage-api.inkeep.com`)

   You'll need all of these when configuring the integration in Nango.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure in Nango">
    In your [Nango dashboard](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), go to the Inkeep integration and enter your Client ID and Client Secret.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Next">
    Follow the [_Quickstart_](/getting-started/quickstart) to connect your first account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connection Configuration

When creating a connection to Inkeep, you'll need to provide the following configuration:

| Field | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| `manageApiUrl` | The URL of your Inkeep Manage API (OAuth/Auth server) | `https://manage-api.inkeep.com` |

These URLs are used to:
- **Manage API URL**: Handle OAuth authorization and token exchange

<Note>The Inkeep team will provide you with your specific API URL when they create your OAuth application.</Note>

For more details, see the [Inkeep API documentation](https://docs.inkeep.com).
